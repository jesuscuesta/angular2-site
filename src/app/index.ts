 * Barrel for our app module.
 * Barrel is a way to group a set of things in the same file,
 * this technique permits you do a unique import instead of
 * import each thing (module, pipe, component, etc..) in
 * different lines. Maybe with only one export it doesn't has sense but
 * we consider a good practice.
